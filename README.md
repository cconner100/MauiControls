# MauiControls
Trying to create a set of Maui controls for the following WinUI controls
NavigationView
TabView
TabViewItem

I can get the first 2 to work, NavigationView will show the menus and TabView will create but Trying to create a TabViewItem when i need to 
place a NavigationPage in the TabViewItem.Content is where i cant figure it out.

To see the issue take a look at Platforms/Windows/ViewModels/MainPageViewModel.
